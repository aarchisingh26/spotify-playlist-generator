# 🎧 Spotify Playlist Generator Script
This Python script allows you to create playlists in your Spotify account as well as add songs right into it!

👉 Developed using: Spotify Web API

## ⚙️ How It Works:
When the script is ran, it will prompt the user to enter the name and then the description of the new playlist they would like to create. After this, the script will continue to prompt the user to enter the name of the song they would like to add. [The script fetches the first song in the search results of Spotify] When the user is satisfied with the songs, they must enter "quit" to terminate the program. The playlist should now be in the user's playlist library on Spotify!
